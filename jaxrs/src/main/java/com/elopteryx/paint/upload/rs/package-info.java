/**
 * The top level of the package hierarchy which contains
 * classes related to using the core library in a
 * Jax-Rs environment.
 *
 * <p>This library includes a lightweight integration of the
 * core package with the Jax-Rs environment. It only has
 * a message body reader to create an upload context object,
 * which needs to extended to be used. There is also only
 * one annotation, which allows you to define size constraints
 * for each endpoint method.
